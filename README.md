# Express.js Route Handler Bug: Missing Error Handling and Poor Error Messages

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: inadequate error handling for invalid inputs and missing users.  The bug leads to generic error responses, hindering debugging and providing poor user experience.

## Bug Description

The `/users/:id` route lacks proper error handling for invalid user IDs and scenarios where a user with the given ID doesn't exist.  Instead of providing specific error messages, a generic 404 or 500 message is sent.

## Bug Solution

The improved route handler incorporates error handling to identify and address potential issues.  This includes better input validation and handling of edge cases. More specific error messages are returned for better user feedback and simplified debugging.
